2. Create an API to Handle GET and POST Requests:
	Write an Express.js application that exposes two routes:
		A GET /message route that returns a JSON response with a message.
		A POST /message route that accepts a JSON body and saves the message to an in-memory array (no database needed).

3. Read and Write Files Using fs Module:
	Write a Node.js program to read a file (e.g., data.txt), update its content, and save it back to the file.

4. Basic Middleware in Express:
	Write an Express middleware function that logs the request method and URL for every incoming request.

5. Asynchronous File Operations:
	Write a program that reads multiple files asynchronously using the fs.promises API or async/await. After reading all files, print their content to the console.

6. User Authentication with JWT:
	Create a simple Node.js API using Express that implements user login with JWT (JSON Web Token). When the user provides a correct username and password, generate a token and send it back in the response.

7.Create a RESTful API for CRUD Operations:
	Create a RESTful API with routes for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a simple resource (e.g., books or users) using Express and an in-memory store (or an actual database if you prefer).

8. API Pagination:
	Implement pagination in a Node.js API. The API should return a paginated list of users, with limit and page query parameters to control the result set size and pagination.

9. Error Handling in Express:
	Write an Express app that properly handles errors. The app should include custom error messages and error codes, and you should handle asynchronous errors using next().

10. Database Connection Pooling with PostgreSQL or MongoDB:
	Set up a connection pool to PostgreSQL (using pg package) or MongoDB (using mongoose) in Node.js. Write a function to perform database queries efficiently.

11. Build a Real-Time Chat Application with Socket.io:
	Build a simple real-time chat application using Node.js and socket.io. The app should allow multiple users to join a chat room and send/receive messages in real time.

12. Task Scheduler with Cron Jobs:
	Write a Node.js script that uses a task scheduler (e.g., node-cron) to run a background job that sends an email notification every day at a specific time.

13. Optimize API Performance with Caching:
	Implement caching in a Node.js API using redis to store frequently requested data. Use the cache to reduce database load and improve response time for certain API endpoints.

14. Rate Limiting in Node.js:
	Implement rate limiting for your Node.js API to prevent abuse. Use the express-rate-limit package or create a custom rate-limiting middleware.

15.Create a Web Scraper:
	Write a program using Node.js and a library like cheerio or puppeteer to scrape data from a website (e.g., news headlines or product listings) and display the data in a structured format.

16. Building a Microservices-based Application:
	Create two simple microservices in Node.js that communicate with each other using HTTP or message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ). One service can handle user authentication, and the other can handle profile data.
